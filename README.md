# 🍳 Kitchen Nightmares (Unity Overcooked-Style Clone)

**Kitchen Nightmares** is a personal Unity project inspired by *Overcooked*.  
I’m building it from scratch to understand how the Unity engine works under the hood — from physics and animation to player input and collisions — while also improving my C# programming skills.

## 🎮 Project Overview

This game is a **fast-paced co-op kitchen simulator** where players cook, chop, and deliver dishes under time pressure.  
My goal isn’t to make a full commercial clone, but to recreate key systems and learn the logic behind them.

### 🧠 Learning Focus
- Building a full game loop with **Unity 6**
- Understanding **C# scripting** in Unity
- Using the **new Input System** (`PlayerInputActions`)
- Applying **physics concepts** like `Physics.CapsuleCast`
- Implementing **animations** with the `Animator` and parameter hashing
- Managing **game objects**, prefabs, and serialized fields
- Practicing **clean code and architecture** (readability, modularity)

---

## 🧩 Features Implemented
- Smooth **player movement and rotation**
- **Collision detection** with capsule casting
- **Basic animation blending** for walking/idle states
- **Input mapping** with Unity’s new Input System
- Organized folder structure with serialized scriptable objects
- In-editor variable control via `[SerializeField]`
- Early foundation for cooking stations, ingredients, and recipes

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **Unity 6** | Main game engine |
| **C#** | Gameplay scripting |
| **Cinemachine** | Camera control & movement |
| **Git + GitHub** | Version control |
| **Visual Studio Code / Rider** | Code editing |

---

## 🚧 Current Goals
- Add interactable objects (counters, plates, ingredients)
- Implement player actions (pick up, drop, chop)
- Introduce timer and scoring system
- Create simple multiplayer/local co-op logic
- Improve visuals, sound, and feedback polish

---

## 📚 What I’m Learning
This project is my sandbox for:
- Understanding Unity’s lifecycle (`Awake`, `Start`, `Update`)
- Designing maintainable components
- Reading and using Unity’s documentation instead of copy-pasting tutorial code
- Experimenting with systems design, debugging, and optimization

---

## 💬 Notes
This repository will continue to evolve as I learn.  
Every feature is a small experiment to deepen my understanding of Unity and C# fundamentals.  
I’ll occasionally refactor or rebuild systems to reinforce what I’ve learned.

## 📸 Preview (Coming Soon)
*(Screenshots or GIFs will be added once gameplay is more complete.)*
